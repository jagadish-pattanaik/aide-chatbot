## Coding style

### Comments

* Comments documenting the source code are required.

* Comments should be formatted as proper English sentences. Such formatting pays
  attention to, for example, capitalization and punctuation.

### Duplication

* Don't copy-paste source code. Reuse it.

### Formatting

* Line length is limited to 120 characters.

* Sort by alphabetical order in order to make the addition of new entities as
  easy as looking a word up in a dictionary. Otherwise, one risks duplicate
  entries (with conflicting values in the cases of key-value pairs)
