<category><pattern>WHAT IS PROGRAM BAWT</pattern>
<template><br/>Significant demand for a version of ALICE compatible with<br/>pre- Java 2 (formerly known as Java 1.2) prompted the<br/>development of "Bawt.java", an open source java program<br/>for chat robot development that works with older versions of<br/>Java, and AWT. Originally program B relied on <br/>Java 2 and Swing, but program Bawt needs only Java 1.1 and AWT.<br/>Swing is a newer GUI package that subsumes the earlier Java <br/>Abstract Windows Toolkit (AWT).<br/> <br/>At present class B merely extends class Bawt. Swing not<br/>supported.<br/> <br/></template>

<category><pattern>WHAT IS A CATEGORY</pattern>
<template><br/> AIML consists of a list of statements called categories.  Each<br/> category contains an input pattern and a reply template. <br/> The syntax of an AIML category is:<br/> <br/> &lt;category&gt;<br/> &lt;pattern&gt; PATTERN &lt;/pattern&gt;  &lt;template&gt; Template &lt;/template&gt;<br/> &lt;/category&gt;<br/> <br/> or<br/> <br/> &lt;category&gt;<br/> &lt;pattern&gt; PATTERN &lt;/pattern&gt;<br/> &lt;that&gt; THAT &lt;/that&gt;<br/> &lt;template&gt; Template &lt;/template&gt;<br/> &lt;/category&gt;<br/> <br/> The AIML category tags are case-sensitive.  Each open tag has an<br/> associated closing tag.  This syntax obviously derives from XML.<br/> <br/></template>

<category><pattern>WHAT IS AIML</pattern>
<template>The ALICE software implements AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup  Language) a non-standard evolving markup language for creating chat robots. The primary design feature of AIML is minimalism.  Compared with other chat robot languages, AIML is perhaps the simplest.  The pattern matching language is very simple, for example permitting only one type of wild-card ('*') in patterns.   AIML is an XML language, implying that it obeys certain grammatical meta-rules.  The choice of XML syntax permits integration with other tools such as XML editors.  Another motivation for XML is its familiar look and feel, especially to people with HTML experience.  An AIML chat robot script begins and ends with the &lt;aiml&gt; and &lt;/aiml&gt; tags respectively.</template>

<category><pattern>WHAT IS THE IMITATION GAME</pattern>
<template>The Game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, "Can machines think?"'</template>

<category><pattern>WHAT IS XML</pattern>
<template><br/> David Bacon pronounces it "Eggsmell".  XML is the Extensible<br/> Markup Language.  Like many "standards" in computer science, XML<br/> is a moving target.  In the simplest terms, XML is just a generalized<br/> version of HTML.  Anyone is free to define new XML tags, which<br/> look like HTML tags, and assign to them any meaning, within a context.<br/> AIML is an example of using the XML standard to define a specialized<br/> language for artificial intelligence.  <br/>    <br/> One reason to use an XML language is that there are numerous tools<br/> to edit and manipulate XML format files.  Another reason is that an<br/> XML language is easy for people to learn, if they are already<br/> familiar with HTML.  Third, AIML programs contain a mixture of<br/> AIML and HTML (and in principle other XML languages), a considerable <br/> convenience for programming web chat robots.<br/>    <br/> A good resource for information on XML is www.oasis-open.org.<br/>    <br/></template>

<template>This idea has been proposed many times, starting in the 1940s.  Eventually, it will be made to work. However, AI programs haven't yet  reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from  physical experience. Nor do present programs understand language well enough  to learn much by reading.  <think>      <set name="it">       <set name="topic">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</set>      </set>     </think></template>

<category><pattern>IS AI ABOUT *</pattern>
<template>Sometimes but not always or even usually. On the one hand, we can learn  something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other  people or just by observing our own methods. On the other hand, most work in  AI involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather  than studying people or animals. AI researchers are free to use methods that  are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people  can do.  <think><set name="it"><set name="topic">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</set></set></think></template>

The philosopher Hubert Dreyfus says that AI is impossible. The computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum says the idea is obscene, anti-human and immoral. Various people have said that since  artificial intelligence hasn't reached human level by now, it must be  impossible. Still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankrupt.</template>
